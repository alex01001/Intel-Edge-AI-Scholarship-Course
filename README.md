My employer has more than 100 manufacturing facilities around the world. Moving forklifts is one of the major sources of injury. Dozens of accidents happen every year. In fact, around a month ago a forklift hit a person and ran over his leg causing a serious injury. 

I came up with an idea of using computer vision to mitigate this type of risk. I installed a camera at one of the facilities, collected sample pictures, trained the model, and built an algorithm which generates light and sound alarms every time the dangerous situation occurs (I use Raspberry Pi). 

I run this system in a trial mode at one plant, but will spread it out to other facilities across the world.
